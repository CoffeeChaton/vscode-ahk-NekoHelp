## part-1 signature show return and doc

> The second is the comments themselves, but I don't understand why, when you enter parameters, you don't show the comment from the function and what it returns?

I just started to provide [SignatureHelp](https://github.com/CoffeeChaton/vscode-autohotkey-NekoHelp#signaturehelp) recently, I think you suggest of the user experience is good, and the next version will provided of user def-function, but build-in function I need 1~2 weekends to check the online documentation.

## part-2 doc-style

> Third, not so significant, I don't understand why there is no space here? And so subjective... I never liked the style where { is on the same line with something, it impairs readability. If there is an option to move this character on a new line - great.

I plan to use the style of each function defined by the user to determine the displayed document style, and it will be ready in about 2~3 weeks.

## part-3 Outline of #include

> Outline shows #include, please make their display optional.

it's very simple.

## part-4 highlight

> I do not understand why you highlight the paths to the libraries in a different color

1. _line 11_, very look like bug, But I can't reproduce it, can you provide a minimal file with the _theme_ you are using?
2. I used to write it with reference to the one that seems to be the most semantic in TextMate.
3. When I chose the string semantics in the early days, I was prevented from completing the path by the `editor.quickSuggestions` preset option of vscode.
4. But now I can solve the completing in string.
5. I think it would be better to use string color matching for the path, because the old style of bracket matching of vscode will get out of control.

exp : `#Include %A_LineFile%\..\ahk_test{.ahk`

## part-5 goto include file

> I would like to be able to ctrl+click to go to the include file.

if you use an absolute path goto the definition file is easy, I forgot to provide it.

## part-6 core parsing error

> I see some obscure method `_sho` that is not in [my class](https://gist.github.com/CzarOfScripts/0f35b616392b494a334b228348b4d35d)

The parsing error introduced by [switch to support unicode](https://github.com/CoffeeChaton/vscode-autohotkey-NekoHelp/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v00322023-04-01), specifically, the `\b` semantics cannot be used when regexp considers non-ascii. At the same time, many of the original methods of exclusion have changed to the method of using the allow list. If you have similar problems, please let me know. These Nice fix, but I'm having a hard time spotting it without triggering.

## part-7 Resolution scope

> I don't see the prompts from [my Include](https://gist.github.com/CzarOfScripts/0f35b616392b494a334b228348b4d35d)
> until I open the [Include file](https://gist.github.com/CzarOfScripts/0f35b616392b494a334b228348b4d35d) in a new tab:

this is by design of [Privacy Statement part 3](https://github.com/CoffeeChaton/vscode-autohotkey-NekoHelp#privacy-statement).
or you can use [Multi-root Workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).

## part-8 find all reference of class

> I see reference for functions, but not for classes and class methods.

Because this is very performance consuming, the use of ahk class is almost as free as global variables, without very obvious features, so every time I trigger find all ref, it is almost the same as ctrl+shift+f, just ignoring the sting/comment.

1. for _class_ , it will take about 3-4 weeks or more.
2. for _class-methods_, If there are no different categories in your project, but the method names are the same, I think this should have a chance to be implemented, but it will only be beta for a long time.

## part-9 signature of command

> Will you do a parameter hint, for such "functions"?

Program goals <https://github.com/CoffeeChaton/vscode-autohotkey-NekoHelp#signaturehelp>

## part-10 jsdoc of type

> And most importantly, do you plan to add design support for functions with JSDoc? I mean, if I want to describe parameters, what type I expect, some description.

1. style just like jsdoc.
2. i would advise you to refer to the v2 way to mark the type.
3. i just support show the type at signature/Completion/hover, but not check. so you can mark any text, as long as you remember what it is.

## part A

> > 1. _line 11_, very look like bug, But I can't reproduce it, can you provide a minimal file with the _theme_ you are using?
>
> Comments along the lines of `;*` color the extension [Better comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments). 

So _line 11_ is governed by Better comments? That's fine, I just forgot there was this extension

> But it's not convenient as hell! Maybe there's a way to enable this as an option?

OK, will be offered as an option.

> > 1. style just like jsdoc.

> Maybe I don't understand something? This is what it looks like in JS: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78804737/231389410-7db717f7-e49a-453e-9316-9af4f37afb8c.png) So with your extension: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78804737/231389494-4e2452de-bb01-4ab9-a11d-e15cb128a488.png) I'm not asking for a type match, but at least a simple display of the type right next to the parameter. As we do in TypeScript.

Not yet implemented, just plan.

> I would also like to ask one more function, if it is possible. Add the same (I think it was called inline hint) hints that point to the name of the parameter in the function. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78804737/231390781-6c3b4906-f8d0-496d-9e8b-0761fa5d6464.png)

will be offered as an option.
